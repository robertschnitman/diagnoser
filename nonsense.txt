This is just a bunch of words that I am making at the top of my head, although true randomness is not achievable because everyone will eventually fall into a pattern (as you have already known and can probably beat me in this area). Statistical computing, data science: does any one care about the former purely external to the latter? Well, there are statistical journals such as, you know, the R Journal and Journal of Statistics Software (which is really just the former journal in a bad disguise), so I guess the answer is yes?
