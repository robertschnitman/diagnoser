## 1. Introduction

The `diagnoser` package contains tools for regression diagnostics. Base R's plot(lm()) was the primary influence, as it was a useful tool for quickly assessing estimation bias and existence of heteroskedasticity; but interpreting more specialized concepts such as Cook's Distance proved to be difficult to understand for those without linear algebra knowledge. To improve upon comprehension for introductory students, I developed **diagnose()** and **ggdiagnose()**. Individuals with a fondness for the classics would appreciate **cdiagnose()**, which recreates the original plot(lm()) with ggplot2 graphics.

Other functions such as **fitres()**, **modeldf()**, and **validate()** were inspired by tidyverse's broom library. While broom eases the process of transforming mnodel objects into data frames, outputs from tidy() lacked estimates integral to the social and health sciences, such as the margin of error for OLS estimates. Additionally, glance() does not produce a pseudo r-squared for general linear models. The functions **modeldf()** and **validate()** seek to fulfill the gaps from these broom functions.

The following sections provide examples.

## 2. diagnose(), ggdiagnose(), and cdiagnose()

The functions **diagnose()** and **ggdiagnose()** provide alternatives for the plot(lm()) approach. The Q-Q, Scale-Location, and Residuals-vs.-Leverage plots in the latter method can present difficulties in interpretations. For example, Cook's Distance typically is not taught at the secondary and undergraduate levels--when it is, teachers will forego explanation of the math due to its complexity and instead focus solely on the interpretation, leaving students in the dark on how the statistic works. If the goal is to maximize students' comprehension of detecting heteroskedasticity, one option is to replace the three previously mentioned graphs with histograms and an addition of another variable: residuals margin, the residuals as a percentage of the values for the dependent variable (i.e. (residuals รท actual values)\*100).

Thinking of residuals in terms of percent differences can help determine their *magnitude*. For example, if you notice an outlier in the residuals having the value of "5", does this issue necessitate a re-estimation of the model that excludes this observation? A common method is to examine the (adjusted) R-squared before-and-after the outlier exclusion. The problem of "mining" the model occurs, however, and heightens the risk of a Type 1 Error (i.e. false positive). One solution, then, is to confirm whether this extremity is substantively different from the rest of the values--you may, based on prior knowledge, decide whether thresholds of 10% or 15% should be marked as such.

Overall, with these functions, students will learn how to visualize homoskedasticity/heteroskedasticity and the magnitude of outliers based on familiar concepts as opposed to being inundated with hastily-taught new ones that assume a sufficient understanding of linear algebra.

However, for those with advanced training or simply disagree with me, I also present a "classic" version of the original base R residual diagnostics plot: **cdiagnose()**, a recreation of plot(lm()) with ggplot2 graphics. The Residuals vs. Leverage graph is the most differentiated one from the original, using the size of the points to indicate the degree of Cook's Distance (as inspired by Raju Rimal's diagPlot(): <https://rpubs.com/therimalaya/43190>).

Because base R's plotting of model objects do not include NLM/NLS objects, neither does **cdiagnose()**, which is justified considering the linear algebra involved in leverage and Cook's Distance. Nonetheless, future work will consider an alternative for non-linear models.

### diagnose()
``` r
# OLS case
model.lm <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ wt + gear)

diagnose(model.lm, fit_type = 'response', residual_type = 'response')
  # The fit_type option specifies prediction type in predict(). 
  # Similarly, residual_type specifies for resid().
  # These inputs are beneficial for glm objects using the binomial family.
```

``` r
# NLS case
require(graphics)
DNase1    <- subset(DNase, Run == 1)
fm1DNase1 <- nls(density ~ SSlogis(log(conc), Asym, xmid, scal), DNase1, model = TRUE)
diagnose(fm1DNase1, point_color = '#00BFC4', line_color = '#F8766D', pch = 16, lwd = 2)
  # Graph editing inputs. Recommended for larger data, as ggplot2 in ggdiagnose() and cdiagnose() can be slow.
```
![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/s2-1-2.png)

### ggdiagnose()
``` r
# NLS case
ggdiagnose(fm1DNase1, fit_type = 'response', residual_type = 'response',
           bins = NROW(mtcars), se = TRUE, freqpct = TRUE, alpha = 0.5)
  # The fit_type option specifies prediction type in predict(). 
  #   Similarly, residual_type specifies for resid().
  #   These inputs are beneficial for glm objects using the binomial family.
  # Default bins value is 30.
  # Default se value is TRUE.
  # Default freqpct value is FALSE.
  # Default alpha value is 1.
```

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/s2-2-1.png)

### cdiagnose()

``` r
model.lm <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ wt + gear)

cdiagnose(model.lm, fit_type = 'response', residual_type = 'response', se = FALSE, alpha = 1)
  # The fit_type option specifies prediction type in predict(). 
  #   Similarly, residual_type specifies for resid().
  #   These inputs are beneficial for glm objects using the binomial family.
  # Default bins value is 30.
  # Default se value is FALSE.
  # Default alpha value is 1.
```

## 3. fitres() & fitresdf()

The functions **fitres()** and **fitresdf()** will look similar to those who have used augment() from tidyverse's broom.

The former creates a matrix of the fitted values, residuals, and residuals as a proportion (percent) based on the actual dependent variable's values. The latter produces a data frame from *merging* the fitted values and residual variables as columns to a specified dataset. If there are any rows with missing values in the original data frame, then they will be moved to the bottom of the new one.

### fitres()

``` r
model.lm <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ wt + gear)

head(fitres(model.lm, type = 'response'))
    # default type value is 'response'.
```

## 4. modeldf()

The function **modeldf()** has similar features to tidying model objects with additions.

### Case 1: OLS

``` r
model.lm <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ wt + gear)

modeldf(model = model.lm, conf = 0.90) # conf = 0.95 is the default value; can be omitted.
```

### Case 2: GLM (logit)

``` r
model.glm <- glm(data = mtcars, formula = am ~ mpg + disp, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))

modeldf(model = model.glm, conf = 0.90) # conf = 0.95 is the default value; can be omitted.
```

    ##          term         beta          se        moe     ci_lower    ci_upper

### Case 3: NLS

``` r
require(graphics)
DNase1    <- subset(DNase, Run == 1)
fm1DNase1 <- nls(density ~ SSlogis(log(conc), Asym, xmid, scal), DNase1, model = TRUE)

    ## 2 1.218541e-10
    ## 3 8.506932e-14

## 5. validate()

The broom library's glance() had a vague label for the F statistic (simply "statistic") and lacked any kind of pseudo R-squared for logistic regressions.

Furthermore, While the same function is friendly for data frames, it's wide form is cumbersome for quickly ascertaining model validity. Thus, **validate()** produces similar output as a column vector, adding McFadden's pseudo R-squared for logistic regressions. Those who wish to have the values in broom's format can always transpose the vector.

### Case 1: OLS

``` r
model.lm <- lm(data = mtcars, formula = mpg ~ wt + gear)
validate(model.lm)
```

    ##                   model.lm

### Case 2: GLM (logit)

``` r
model.glm <- glm(am ~ mpg + wt, mtcars, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))
validate(model.glm)
```

## 6. Conclusion

I hope to improve upon these existing functions and create new ones that (1) minimize the programming tedium in statistical reporting and (2) assist people in diagnosing the validity of their results.
